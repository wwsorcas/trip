    "# A Python interface to IWAVE\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes the modeling package IWAVE and some convenient  Python interfaces to it. IWAVE manipulates data in two disk storage formats commonly used in the geophysical research community, especially the industry-oriented part:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. SEGY traces, in the form popularized by Seismic Unix from Colorado School of Mines, and\n",
    "2. RSF gridded data, from the Madagascar project at UT Austin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like almost all scientific data, these data structures consist of arrays of data samples, together with \"metadata\" describing their meaning - sample rates, numbers of samples, units, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "IWAVE treats the data arrays as vectors, and the metadata as defining vector spaces. That is, only data arrays sharing the same metadata can participate in pairwise vector operations (linear combination, dot product). IWAVE finite difference simulators for wave equations are set up to read and write their necessary data from SEGY and RSF files, and  define linear or nonlinear operators between the vectors spaces specified by the file metadata. IWAVE is written in C/C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python interface to IWAVE accesses executable IWAVE commands via system calls. Arguments to functions in this interface are combined to form commands in the form of Python strings, which are then fed to the command line via *os.system(...)*. \n",
    "\n",
    "This interface consists of two modules:\n",
    "\n",
    "*linalg* defines linear algebra operations and a simple plotting interface for data vectors stored in either SU or RSF format. The operations include\n",
    "\n",
    "1. copy(x,y) - does what you'd think, copies x over y.\n",
    "2. lincomb(a,x,y,b=1.0) - classic axpy with the default for the fourth argument, otherwise y=a*x+b*y.\n",
    "3. norm(x) - returns L2 norm, that is, l2 norm weighted by grid element volume (rsf) or dt (su)\n",
    "4. dot(x,y) - inner product, defined similarly to norm\n",
    "5. simplot(f, addcb=False, width=7, asprat=-1) - simple matplotlib interface to plot SU or RSF file f, either as a line plot (1D data) or color scale (2D data). The 2D case offers several optional inputs: addcb toggles colorbar, width is in inches, asprat (aspect ratio) defaults to either 1 (for su gathers) or 1:1 for rsf. This utility is intended for simple \"quick and dirty\" standard plots in jupyter notebook use. For more involved plotting (eg. scale control, multiple lines in different colors, ray overlays on color scale plots, and so on), users will have to code appropriate plotting commands from scratch. \n",
    "\n",
    "*op* provides access to acoustic staggered grid finite difference simulator in IWAVE, with most parameters defaulted to values appropriate for the set of examples presented here. Some of these parameters may be worth turning into keyword params with defaults. \n",
    "\n",
    "This finite difference simulator implements $m, w \\mapsto F[m]w=d$, in the notation of our papers. The function interface is\n",
    "*fdop(m, w, d)*: m = bulk modulus model RSF format (input, buoyancy = 1 cm^3/g), w = source in SU format (input), d = pressure traces SU format (output). All files including output must exist on call. In particular output file must be initialized before calling this function, and is overwritten. Two interpretations: (1) linear operator $F[m]: w \\mapsto d$ or (1) nonlinear operator $F[\\cdot]w: m \\mapsto. d$.\n",
    "\n",
    "*op* also provides a function implementing the convolutional representation of the simulator. This representation is far less computationally expensive than the finite difference simulator for repeated simulation with different sources, as is required in an iterative estimation of sources. For use in least-squares algorithms, a convolutional representation of the adjoint  operator ($F[m]^T$) is also provided. \n",
    "\n",
    "The function interface for the convolutional representation is *convop(g, w, d, adj)*: g is a Green's function, pre-computed by applying *fdop* to a digital delta function $\\delta$. *adj* is an integer flag with default value 0, indicating application of the forward (adj = 0) or adjoint (adj $\\ne$ 0) operator. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "\n",
    "It's easiest to explain how all of this really works via an example. The module *data* defines the components of this example via Python functions. \n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk modulus is a low-velocity lens, minimum value 1.6 GPa, in a constant background of 4 GPa. It is sampled on a regular rectangular grid of size 4000 m (depth, z, 1st axis) $\\times$ 8000 m (horizonal, x, 2nd axis), with sample steps of 20 m in both directions. The data and metadata are stored as RSF files: the metadata (axis descriptions) in an ascii (human-readable) file 'bml0.rsf' in the working directory, and the data in a binary file 'bml0.rsf@' somewhere else (the RSF default is /var/tmp, but you can choose some other part of the file system to store binary data - see the Madagascar documentation).  While the buoyancy plays the role of a parameter, rather than an argument to $F$, it must be supplied to fully define the acoustic model. For this example, it is constant at 1 cm$^3$/g. The function *model* in the data module creates both (the buoyancy file name is always the bulk modulus file name prefixed with \"by\"):"

Sources (right-hand sides in wave equations, $w$ in $F[m]w$) are presumed to be sums of spatial deltas multiplied by functions of time. So the SEGY trace data represents the function of time, and the SEGY metadata (specifically header words gx and gelev) locate the spatial delta in depth z and horizontal position x.\n",

Also, locations of sources are completely arbitrary: IWAVE transfers them to functions on the grid by adjoint interpolation.\n",

Even worse, the SEGY standard requires that the time step be given in $\\mu$s (microseconds) - in order that it be represented by a short integer (the standard dates to 1975, when mass storage was orders of magnitude less capable thaan it is today).\n",

Typical geophysical quantities are $O(1)$ in these units.\n"

In particular, the solution of the wave equation with a point isotropic radiator right-hand side $w(t)\\delta(x-x_s)\\delta(z-z_s)$ is the same as the convolution of $w(t)$ with the solution with right-hand side $\\delta(t)\\delta(x-x_s)\\delta(z-z_s)$.

In adjoint mode, every data trace is adjoint-convolved (cross-correlated) with the corresponding Green's function trace and the result added to the output source trace The second case requires that the source file contain as many traces as the Green's function. In this second use case, forward (adjoint) mode convolves (adjoint-convolves) each source (data) trace with the corresponding trace in the Green's function to produce an output data (source) trace.

As always for IWAVE operators, the output vector must be initialized with the correct metadata before application of $F[m]$, so that it defines the domain space, where the output of the adjoint should be.

    "1. verify that this is actually the conjugate gradient method for solving the normal equation $F[m]^TF[m]w = F[m]^Td$. You can find a description in practically any Numerical Analysis textbook - for example, Algorithm 5.2 in Nocedal and Wright. I have rewritten it in a convenient form for implementation, using additional variables which are mostly necessary for storing intermediate results within a single iteration. There is no need to  store the vector values ($w$, $r$, etc.) for every iteration, however, so I have written the updates in overwrite mode rather than as rules for generating sequences, as the textbooks tend to do.\n",

    "3. use it to solve a source estimation algorithm.\n",

    "Note that here $F[m]$ will indicate the convolutional representation. So you will need to include code to generate the Green's function before starting the iteration.\n",
