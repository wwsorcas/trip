    "# Python Classes for Vector Calculus\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook overviews a Python library based on \"Object structure of vector calculus\", hereinafter *VC*. The central thrust of VC is that a mimetic approach to vector calculus, with computation imitating mathematics as closely as possible, is necessarily object-oriented. The essential objects are also structurally constrained.\n",
    "\n",
    "The core mathematical types of vector calculus are normed vector spaces, vectors, linear operators or maps, and differentiable functions. My particular objective is mimetic expression of continuous optimization algorithms, which generally presume an inner product, so norms are assumed here to be inner product norms. This notebook reviews a Python realization of the structure explained in VC, with a few simple examples based on NumPy. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Spaces and Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "As explained in VC, (pre-Hilbert) vector spaces combine a set of data objects with two operations on them, linear combination and inner (dot) product. The set of data objects has infinite cardinality except in one obvious instance, so is not computationally realizable. However it is sufficient to be able to determine whether an object is a member of the set, and to obtain a new object in the set on request (\"let $v \\in V$\"). These observations translate into four pseudo-code attributes of a Space object:\n",
    "1. a boolean function that takes an object argument and returns True if the argument refers to a data object for this space;\n",
    "2. a function with no arguments that returns a new data object;\n",
    "3. a linear combination function that evaluates $y=ax + by$, with arguments $a$, $b$ (scalars), $x$, and $y$ (data objects). Error if either $x$ or $y$ is not a valid data object;\n",
    "4. an inner product function that returns a scalar $\\langle x, y \\rangle$ for arguments $x$ and $y$. Error if either $x$ or $y$ is not a data object.\n",
    "\n",
    "All Spaces have these attributes, so the collection of Spaces is naturally expressed as an abstract class. In Python,"

    "While vector space is an abstract concept, emulated in code by an abstract type, the definition of vector is entirely concrete: it is a data object (a member of $V$, in the notation of the paper) *together with* with a vector space and its attributes. The almost-universal mathematical vernacular calls the data objects \"vectors\" As explained in VC, this is logically incorrect, but also misleading: data objects must be combined with the other attributes of their vector space to act functionally as vectors. So a vector is not a data object alone, but a composite of a data object *together with* a vector space with its linear combination and inner product functions, for which the data object belongs to its proper set of data objects.\n",

    "For a simple example, I will construct a vector space based on NumPy. This choice makes a point: NumPy is already a fine environment for matrix algebra. However it does not offer interfaces for functions on subsets of vector spaces, nor for expression of algorithms defined in terms of vector functions, such as Newton's method. NumPy's array manipulation capabilities support straightforward construction of a vector space type, in the form of a *Space* as defined (partly) above. The key choice is to us NumPy *ndarrays* as the data objects. Each space corresponds mathematically to ${\\bf R}^n$, so is characterized by its dimension. So an object is a data object of an *npSpace* if it is an column *numpy.ndarray* of the right dimension. "

Obviously the domain and range spaces could also be copied, but that would be logically incorrect as well as inconvenient. With the *MatrixOperator* storing references to externally defined spaces, membership in those spaces can be verified by simple comparison: to know that a *vcl.Vector* x is a member of the domain, for example, simply check the value of *x.space==self.dom*. It is not enough to check that the input vector and the domain have the same dimension.

    "The *jet* concept solves an obvious consistency vs. efficiency problem involving the attributes of functions. Suppose that *f* is a *vcl,Function*, and *x* is a *vcl.Vector*. Record the function's value in the *vcl.Vector* *y*, and the derivative in the *vcl.LinearOperator* *df*. Some number of lines later in the program, access these same objects. Is there any guarantee that they are still related in the same way? In fact, there is not. If *x* is changed but the function is not re-evaluated, then the three objects have become inconsistent. The only way to make sure that this inconsistency does not occur appears to be re-computing the value and derivative each time they are accessed. That could amount to considerable wasted computational effort.\n",
    "\n",
    "Jets, in the sense meant here, borrow a concept from differential geometry, and offer a way around this problem. There are several equivalent definitions, of which I cite the one most relevant to computation. The $k$-jet of a $C^{\\infty}$ function $f$ at a point $x$ in its domain is the sequence of values $D^{\\alpha}f(x)$ of $f$ and all of its derivatives of orders $|\\alpha| \\le k$. This definition suggests an obvious container class, implemented in $vcl.Jet$. For the time being, I have implemented only the 1-jet. The constructor arguments are the *vcl.Function* *f* and *vcl.Vector* *x*. The methods *getPoint*, *getValue*, and *getDeriv* return the computational analogues of $x$, $f(x)$, and $Df(x)$ respectively. These are stored as internal copies, so changing *x* after creation of *vcl.Jet(f,x)* does not change the return values of these methods. Thus an instance of *vcl.Jet* provides access to a consistent set of values.\n",
    "\n",
    "An earlier implementation of this concept in the C++ library RVL used access control and the *const* keyword to prevent any violation of the jet's internal data, so really offered a guarantee that the return values of its methods are coherent. Such guarantees are impossible to provide in Python, which does not implement *const* and makes all class data public. So *vcl.Jet* really only provides guidance to help the programmer maintain the coherence of function values. Vector data is also private in RVL, and can only be altered through the action of a few specified function classes. This restriction makes a *versioning* system possible. The jet methods compare the version index of a vector with a recorded index to tell whether the vector had been altered, thus update values and derivatives automatically whenever necessary. So RVL implements the jet concept as *f(x) for variable x*. Such automation is impossible in a Python framework: the VCL user is responsible for updating *vcl.Jet* instances as needed. "

    "Variable projection is a minimization algorithm for a function of two (vector) variables $f(x_1,x_2)$, of class $C^2$. Suppose that for each $x_1$, $\\tilde{x}_2(x_1)$ is a local minimizer of $x_2 \\rightarrow f(x_1,x_2)$, and that $\\tilde{x}_2$ is of class $C^1$. This is the case if, for example, the Hessian $D_2^2 f(x_1,\\tilde{x}_2 (x_1))$ is positive definite symmetric. Define $\\tilde{f}(x_1)=f(x_1,\\tilde{x}_2 (x_1))$. It follows directly from the chain rule that if $x_1$ is a stationary point of $\\tilde{f}$, then $(x_1,\\tilde{x}_2(x_1))$ is a stationary point of $f$."
