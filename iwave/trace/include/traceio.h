/** \section tracegeom 

Trace Geometry. Consists of struct defining sampling etc. and
storing essential trace header and i/o status information, together
with constructor, initializer, destructor, sampler, writer, and
printer functions. The struct stores information for only one shot
record at a time. Constructor connects the object to header (trace
input) and data (trace output) files, which may be the
same. Initializer populates the struct with data from the next shot
record, read from the header file; this data includes all essential
header words and may include trace samples. Sampler interacts with a
grid, extracting samples at trace locations and storing them in the
trace buffer data member of the struct. Writer dumps the current trace
buffer to the data file. These functions rely on an internal
traceserver object, which hides details of parallelism and data
distribution.

/** Initialization for trace geometry object. Takes spatial geometry
    and start and end time from input file. Time sample rate specified
    externally (arg dt), determines buffer allocation. Time unit is ms. It
    is ASSUMED that any common spatial data (eg. scalel, scalco) is
    uniform, and may be read from any trace.

    The data to be sampled repeatedly to form traces are assumed to
    functions on a uniform rectangular grid. The construction of
    samples differentiates between a LOCAL grid, meaning the grid on
    which the data to be sampled are being updated by the process, and
    a GLOBAL grid, of which the LOCAL grid is a subgrid. Index tuples
    are defined by the GLOBAL grid. The sampling function (below) is
    supplied with the index tuple of the LOCAL grid origin, which
    enables conversion from global indices to local offset.

    This function does several tasks, using the tracegeom struct to 
    record its results:

    - timestepping setup: records time steps, determines number of 
      time steps necessary;

    - sampling setup: determines source and receiver positions
      relative to a GLOBAL grid, and sets up sampling coefficients
      ("rectangular barycentric coordinates") for traces which lie in a
      LOCAL subgrid. This task requires two sets of origin coordinates, one 
      for the GLOBAL grid, one for the LOCAL subgrid. Also allocates buffer 
      into which samples may be recorded;
    
    - trace output setup: records headers necessary to write
      output to traces, and computes output time sampling info 
      either from the input trace header or from input arguments;

    - data input: optionally initializes sampling buffer by reading 
      data from file.

    The routine may be called several times to initialize any number
    of time series on the same internal time grid. This internal
    (stepping) time grid is fixed by the requirement tha (1) the step
    be given by the input argument dt, and (2) t=0 is a sample point.
    
    arguments:
    
    @param[out] tg (\ref tracegeom *) trace geometry object to be initialized
    @param[in] og (\ref RPNT)
       coordinates of GLOBAL grid origin (grid point with all indices = 0) 
         relative to physical
         coordinate system. The physical coordinate system refers to the
	 physical domain, and is the coordinate system with respect to
	 which the source and receiver coordinates are defined. These
	 numbers (lengths, not indices!) give the coordinates of the global
	 computational grid origin in the physical system. 
    @param[in] n (\ref IPNT) number of samples on each axis for the LOCAL subgrid in which
      traces are to be sampled.
    @param[in] o (\ref RPNT) coordinates of LOCAL subgrid origin.
    @param[in] d (\ref RPNT) spatial steps (common to GLOBAL grid and LOCAL subgrid)
    @param[in] dt (float)
      time step in ms. input argument, NOT read from file - 
        computed by the simulator, actual time step between time
        levels of simulation. Recorded in tracegeom object as tg->dt.
    @param[in] ndim (int) dimension of GLOBAL and LOCAL grids.
    @param[in] usernt,usert0 (int, float)
      optional specification of number output samples and time of first output
      sample. 
      If set (i.e. usernt > 0), then
      <ol>
      <li> output sample rate (tg->dtout) set to simulator-supplied rate (dt);</li>
      <li> number of output samples (tg->ntout) set to usernt;</li>
      <li> number of simulation time steps (tg->nt) set to usernt;</li>
      <li> time of first output sample (tg->t0out) is set to usert0, possibly
      adjusted so that t=0 is a sample;</li>
      <li> time of first simulation sample (tg->t0) also set to usert0.</li>
      </ol>
      [this option is mostly useful in convergence tests and the like].
      If NOT set (i.e. usernt <= 0) then 
      <ol>
      <li> output sample rate (tg->dtout) read from file, and used together
      with cubic interpolation (see \ref cubic) to write traces;</li>
      <li> number of output samples (tg->ntout) read from file (usernt ignored);</li>
      <li> time of first output sample (tg->t0out) read from file (usert0 ignored);</li>
      <li> number of simulation time steps (tg->nt) computed from dt, tg->dtout, tg->t0out, and tg->ntout;</li>
      <li> time of first simulation sample (tg->t0) computed from tg->t0out and dt so that 
          simulation grid includes t=0 as a sample point.</li>
</ol>
      Thus in the second case (usernt NOT set) the simulator output is interpolated
      onto the time sampling of the file used to initialized the tracegeom.
    @param[in] initbuf (int)
      flag for data initiation. If set, data traces are read
        and transferred to the internal simulation (tg->dt,tg->nt,tg->t0) grid by cubic spline interpolation (initbuf > 0) or adjoint cubic
	interpolation (initbut < 0) (see \ref cubic). To avoid temp storage, this option implemented by
	another pass through file.

	ADDED 22.10.08: AXIS ORDERING

	@param[in] axord (int) The axord argument codes axis order as follows:
	<ol>
	<li>for 1D, who cares - z index is zero in any case, so check that axord[0]=0;</li>
	<li>for 2D, axord[0]=index of z, axord[1]=index of x - check that values are legit;</li>
	<li>for 3D, axord[0]=index of z, axord[1]=index of x, axord[2]=index of y - check that values are legit.
</ol>

@param[in] order (int) interpolation order for non-grid source and receiver positions - current legal values are 0 and 1
      
@param[in] stream (FILE *) verbose output stream

@return 0 on successful completion, else error code as in base/include/utils.h.

  outdated material:

    Version 1.1 addendum: this function now both samples the field to the

    onto the field (load) mode. The load flag determines which option is
    taken. In load mode, an additional option is provided to scale the

    the time step. This option is switched by the multiplier field pointer; 
    a null value indicates no scaling. Global grid geometry data supplied,
