mps/main:

-- D_scal.cc/.x - Code for applying a fractional calculus operator on a scalar MPS.
-- W_res.cc/.x - Code for computing normalized residual, weighted by frac cal op.

  		         density (asg) with canonical scalar MPS. Outout is assumed to be 
		 	 pressure data.

  			     acoustic media with variable density (asg FD solver).
-- asg_p_scal.cc/.x - Driver for running forward simulator for acoustics, variable density, 
  		      (asg) with scalar MPS. Output is assumed to be pressure data.
-- asg_p_scal_inv.cc/.x - Driver for estimating scalar MPS, assuming an acoustic media with
  		          variable density (asg FD solver).

-- tg_setup.cc/.x - Code for modifying time axis of a collection of SU files to a single 
  		    time axis uniform to all traces. Handy for concatenating SU files.
-- tgs_n_cat.cc/.x - Code for concatenating SU files of with matching time axis.


mps/howto: 

-- include/MPS_howto.hh - Example of a simple MPS space class.
-- main/MPS_howto.cc - Example driver for running MPS forward simulation.


The mps/tests directory contains a set of modular tests mainly for development and debugging
purposes. Tests outputs will not be too instructive for a non-familiarized developer.
