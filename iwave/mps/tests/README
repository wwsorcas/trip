This directory contains testing libraries for several core MPS classes.
To compile test code cd to test directory and run scons command. To run
tests cd to /run directory and run scons command.
Example commands for compiling and running mps_conv tests: 
	cd mps_conv; scons; cd run; scons

Output of tests is dumped into OUTFILE.txt for each test directory. In 
case a test is failed uncomment the VERBOSE_MJB macro in /src/includes/test_kernel.hh
for that particular test directory to output more information.
