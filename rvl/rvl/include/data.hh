  /** DataContainer is the principal RVL abstraction for types
      encapsulating data structures. This abstract type is intended to
      encompass an arbitrary number of levels of indirection (cartesian
      product structures, for example, or trees, or...) hence provides
      no actual access to data. All interaction with data takes place
      through evaluation of FunctionObjects.

      In GoF terms, the FO and DC hierarchies together exemplify the
      Visitor pattern, in its Acyclic variant defined by Martin. The
      DCs are the Visited types (i.e. the Elements, in terms of the
      GoF chapter).

      We have chosen to locate control of evaluation in the
      DataContainer class rather than in the FunctionObject
      class. This decision is standard in the Visitor pattern,
      i.e. that the visited type controls access, and allows
      FunctionObjects to be reused across wide categories of
      DataContainers, without needing to be aware of data structure
      details. If we were to locate control in the FunctionObject
      type, then each FO would need to be coded to deal correctly with
      every type of DC. Many FOs are simple scalar operations, like
      linear combination, which are evaluated in the same way on every
      DataContainer at the level of data, but which need not be aware
      of the overall structure if DataContainers control execution.

      Ultimately some DataContainer subtype must actually provide
      access to data, else nothing happens. An example of such a
      construction is the LocalDataContainer class template in
      LocalRVL.
