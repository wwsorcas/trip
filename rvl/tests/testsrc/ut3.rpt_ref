 *            BEGIN RVL UNIT TEST 3              *
 * Purpose: direct test of StdProductDC          *
 * behaviour (as opposed to indirect tests       *
 * via ProductSpace in UT4). Also tests          *
 * value extraction (method getValue) and        *
 * retention in UnaryFOScalarRedn class.         *
 *************************************************/

1. Construct RnArray<float>s of lengths 5 and 10 

2. Construct RVLAssignConst, val = 2

3. Construct StdProductDataContainer p, push RnArrays onto 
   so that it has size 2

4. Assign val = 2 to all components of the StdProductDC
   by evaluation of the FO constructed in step 2

5. Construct another RVLAssignConst<float>, val = 3

6. Build two more RnArrays of lengths 5, 10 resp., 
   another StdProductDC q, and push the RnArrays onto
   q, so that it also has length 2 and components compatible
   with those of p

7. Evaluate the FO constructed in step 5 on q, so that all
   components have value 3

8. Construct RVLL2innerProd FO

9. Evaluate RVLL2innerProd on p, q

10. Extract value of inner product, using getValue method of
    UnaryFOScalarRedn class - value = 90, should = 90
