/** \mainpage Sequence Space

RVL implementation of the (infinite dimensional) space of finite sequences. Cited in the 
<a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1499096.1499097">RVL design paper</a> to show that dimension is not a universal attribute of RVL::Space instances, hence should not be accessed as part of the base class interface.
