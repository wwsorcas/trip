The Rice Vector Library ("RVL") provides
  <ul>
    <li>a system of types for portable expression of coordinate- and representation-free
    ("matrix free") algorithms in optimization and linear algebra, and
    </li>
    <li>uniform mechanisms to build concrete instances of these types via computations of
    arbitrary complexity.
    </li>
  </ul>

  RVL enables high-quality implementations of numerical algorithms to
be shared across the wide variety of data structures and computing
platforms that occur in solving large-scale simulation-driven
optimization problems arising in science and engineering. Algorithms
such as Krylov subspace methods (CG, LSQR, BiCGStab,...), quasi-Newton
methods (L-BFGS, Trust Region Truncated Newton,...), matrix-free and
active set SQP, IRLS, ISTC, FISTA, and so on can be coded once and
used <i>without alteration</i> to solve a wide variety of control, design, and inverse
problems, in Un*x computing environments ranging from laptops to
high-performance massively parallel clusters.
<p>
  This library is written entirely in ISO C++, and uses its abstraction facilities
  to achieve portability across applications and
  environments. While other means exist to accomplish these ends, C++ is
  universally available in HPC systems, provides object-oriented and
  generic programming models, and offers easy access to
  many existing high performance numerical and infrastructure libraries written in C and
  Fortran.
<p>
The current release uses the shared pointer class from C++11, so the compiler must support these.
<p>
<b>Obtaining RVL:</b>
<p>
See the <a href="http://www.trip.caam.rice.edu/software/software.html">TRIP software page</a> for current download instructions and release notes.

  <p>
  <b>Subpackage directory:</b>

  <ul> <li> <a href="../../rvl/doc/html/index.html">RVL</a> -
Fundamental interfaces defining <i>calculus in Hilbert space</i>:
vector spaces, vectors, linear and nonlinear scalar- and vector-valued
functions, and closely related concepts such as product (block data,
operator) decompositions and abstract quality control tests for
derivatives, adjoints, etc. Also <i>data management</i> types (data
containers, function objects) - uniform abstract interfaces to
concrete data structures and implementations.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../local/doc/html/index.html">LocalRVL</a> - A simple
realization of the data management hierarchy for containers that
expose a pointer to a contiguous block of memory (C or Fortran
arrays). Useful both in itself and as building block for more complex
in-core, out-of-core, and distributed data management
schemes. Includes various utilities.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../mpirvl/doc/html/index.html">MPIRVL</a> - MPI wrappers for
the local RVL classes - makes them available in various ways (from
serial on rank 0 to various forms of distribution) in distributed
applications.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../alg/doc/html/index.html">Algorithm</a> - An algorithm is
a von Neumann machine, that is, you start it and it runs until it
stops. This subpackage contains simple abstractions for Algorithms and
Terminators (objects equipped to give an answer, "yes" or "no" on
various grounds, to the question, "should this algorithm
continue?"). Various standard combinations build loops, lists,
decision trees etc. and give an elegant mechanism for expressing
virtually any iterative algorithm.  </li> <li> <a
 href="../../umin/doc/html/index.html">Umin</a> - Unconstrained
minimization and iterative linear algebra algorithms, realized as
RVL::Algorithms. Quasi-Newton, trust region, Krylov subspace methods
for optimization, linear systems, and eigenvalue problems.  </li> <li>
<a href="../../seq/doc/html/index.html">Sequence</a> - Example,
discussed in the <a
 href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1499096.1499097">design
paper</a>, showing how infinite dimensional vector spaces can actually
be implemented in RVL, implying that dimension cannot be a general
attribute of an RVL vector space. Defines space of finite sequences, a
linear operator on them (polynomial multiplication), and approximates
the solution of a least squares problem. 
<li> <a
 href="../../tests/doc/html/index.html">Tests</a> - a small set of
unit tests to verify correct installation of RVL and LocalRVL.  </li>
</ul>

 thesis</a>, which also includes a discussion of adaptive timestepping
 in simulation-driven optimization, and application to optimizing well
 rates.  <p>

reflection inversion, as described for example in <i>From modelling to 
inversion: designing a well-adapted simulator</i>,

RVL grew out of the Hilbert Class Library project, whose main authors
were Mark Gockenbach and William Symes. Earlier work by Jon Claerbout,
Dave Nichols, Lester Dye, and others provided important inspirations
for the design of HCL and later RVL. Shannon Scott, Tony Padula and
William Symes created the first usable version of RVL in 2004-5. The
package was subsequently refined and enhanced by Symes, Hala Dajani,
Marco Enriquez, and Dong Sun. The TOMS paper describes in detail the
relation between RVL and similar projects. Tony Padula invented the
Algorithm package and described it in his PhD thesis. Padula also
wrote the first version of the Umin package. Marco Enriquez and
William Symes developed the Time-stepping for optimization package.

<p> Development of RVL and related projects was made possible by
grants from from the National Science Foundation, the Department of
Energy, ExxonMobil Upstream Research Company, and by generous support
from the sponsors of The Rice Inversion Project.
