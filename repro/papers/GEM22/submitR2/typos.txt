A very-incomplete typo list (I do suggest getting out your grammatical fine-toothed comb and checking for more of these):

-p 6 line 23 "is not be well-defined"
-p 13 line 24 there is a sigma without a \

-P 21 line 40 The sentence beginning "Differentiate" is missing some important part-of-speech for which I should have a name but don't, perhaps a subject?
-p26 line 28 missing )
-p26 line 48 sentence fragment beginning "To illustrate"
-p26 line 62 missing space in is measured
