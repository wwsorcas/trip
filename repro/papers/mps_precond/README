The project directory contains an SContruct for running tests and making
Figs pertinent to the paper. Simly project/scons prior to compiling paper.

NOTE:
Just about every figure will be generated like this, except test*-plots.pdf
figures that plot convergence results for the several tests. These figure 
are included when downloading this directory but can be rebuilt from scratch
after running the tests (i.e., after calling project/scons) and running matlab
script project/Matlab_code/Mscript.m
