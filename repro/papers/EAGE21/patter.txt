Surface source extended FWI permits source energy to spread over a surface containing the acquisition footprint while fitting data, controlling the energy spread via an appropriate penalty. For transmission configurations such as cross-well or long-offset (diving wave), the resulting solution closely approximates the result of traveltime tomography, without use of explicit time picks, and in particular avoids characteristic FWI cycle-skipping stagnation. Thus surface-source extended FWI may provide a supplement to low-frequency FWI, or an alternative when low-frequency data is unavailable.

After detailing surface source extended FWI, we give two examples: a 2D synthetic cross-well inversion with triplication, and a 3D velocity model-building exercise based on a marine survey and TTI modeling. With a suitable initial model, standard FWI fails, whereas its surface source extension succeeds in constructing a kinematically reasonable velocity in both cases. We end by sketching the theoretical basis of this approach to velocity model building, issues of computational cost, and potential cost-reduction approaches.
