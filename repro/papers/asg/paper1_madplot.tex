 grid dispersion error is minimal.}

Comparing to Figure \ref{fig:wtrace}, notice that the dispersion error for
the 20 m grid is considerably smaller, but the results for finer grids
are nearly identical to those produced by the (2,4) grids - almost all
of the remaining error is due to the presence of discontinuities in
the model.}
